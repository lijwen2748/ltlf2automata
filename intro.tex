\section{Introduction}

While LTL is defined on infinite traces, $LTL_f$ is interpreted over finite traces. Due to their different characteristics, they are also applied in different fields. While LTL is applied to areas that require constant computation, such as formal-verification, $LTL_f$ is used as a specification language to describe finite behaviors in areas such as automatic synthesis of software.
